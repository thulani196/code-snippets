### 1. Flynn Data Warehouse
In this project, we worked with Flynn Restaurants Group on creating a consolidated platform for their Data Warehouse. Additionally, we provided
best practices for building new Azure Resources, Security, and Data Factory. Using a combination of Azure Data Factory and Azure SQL Server we assisted in the creation of an import process of data from Taco Bell into a single data model to be used for reporting.
### 2. Payment-Gateway
This is a Zig internal project in which we wrap various Mobile Money processing services around a single project. These include Airtel Money, MTN Money, and ECOBANK's mastercard 
payment services.
### 3. Condor Analytics PoC
In collaboration with Data Consumed, the aim for this Project was to develop a Proof of concept around Candor Analytics from documents for Rittenhouse. They needed to extract all
sorts of analytics from their reports, such as Sentiments, Topics being discussed, and most importantly, Condor; which would then be used to help investors make the right decisions
in which business to invest in to depending on the Condor extracted from the said documents.

### 4. Plant Disease Detection API
Yet another internal Zig Project. We built a deep learning model using Transfer Learning with Pytorch and got above 90% accuracy. We then built a Simple Flask api to expose the learned model to web apps to accept images as input through an HTTP Request. Both Notebook and API are attached.
